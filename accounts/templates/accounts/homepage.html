                    <p class="text-inherit white-text">This a picture of a man.  That man’s name is Jonah.
                        Jonah loves learning languages.  Jonah speaks five languages and has 
                        spent extended periods of time in different countries, meeting people
                        and practising his languages.  Jonah has loved every minute of his experiences,
                        however, one element of his travels has always been particularly challenging:
                        making lasting friendships.  Now, I know what you are thinking; maybe Jonah is
                        a werido. This is possible, however, as far as we can tell, Jonah is quite
                        normal (apart from his obsession with language-learning).  The simple truth
                        is that people are often so busy with their own lives that they don’t have time
                        to make friends with travelling weirdos like Jonah.  This is where we come in.

                    <p class="text-inherit paragraph-padding">Our aim is to facilitate the process of making
                        target-language-speaking friends by putting you right in the heart 
                        of a family or household.  You will live, work, eat and, most importantly,
                        converse(!) with your host(s) everyday and, before long, you’ll be
                        nattering away in Finish or French or Farsi as part of the family.  
                        Gone are the days of spending inordinate sums on language courses
                        abroad only to learn from a textbook and speak English with the
                        other foreign students or of spending days off wandering around 
                        with no-one to talk to!

                        You can sign up either as a “host” or as a “worker”.
                        A subscription to this website as a “worker” will allow you to make a profile,
                        search through host “offerings” and contact the hosts with whom you would like
                        to stay.  A subscription as a “host” will allow you to create an “offering”
                        and to search for and contact workers who you think would be a good fit for your
                        residence.  Generally, a worker would be required to work a certain number of
                        hours per day in exchange for meals and lodging (provided by the host).  A
                        host must also bear in mind that the principal reason for the worker’s stay
                        is to learn the language, so including the worker in the day-to-day rhythms
                        of the family is paramount (mealtimes, games, trips).
